VIDEO APPLICATION

The Video Application is a wrapper for omxplayer and mplayer. It can be used to play videos (ideally h264) and music. Video Application runs both on standard Linux PCs and Raspberry Pi. When opening a file, it looks for /usr/bin/omxplayer. If not found, it assumes that it is running on a PC and falls back to /usr/bin/mplayer.

Features (the following commands can be sent to both supported players):
-> Play / Pause / Stop
-> Seek back / forward (2 step sizes)
-> Volume increase / decrease
-> Speed increase / decrease
-> Toggle subtitles (on / off)

In order to get the Video Application running, you have to do the following steps
-> Install either omxplayer or mplayer (for best performance, use omxplayer on Raspberries and mplayer on PCs). The executables must be located at /usr/bin/ (if necessary, create a symlink or change the path in piRemoteServer -> VideoApplication.java -> startProcess()).
-> If you want to use Video Application with omxplayer, create a text file ~/.omxplayer (meaning: create a file called .omxplayer in the home folder of the user that will run piremote). In the text file, paste the contents from appendix A.
-> If you want to use Video Application with mplayer, create a key config file for mplayer in the default location, typically ~/.mplayer/input.conf (~/ being the home folder of the user that will run piremote). In the text file, paste the contents from appendix B.
-> Above config file bind the players' keys to a schema that PiRemote can talk to. If you want to use different locations, you need to modify the source code.

== Known issues ==
-> A client connecting to the server after playback has started will not see the filename of the media currently being played. This is normal.
-> On Raspberry Pi 1 omxplayer takes a while to start up. Please give it some time (up to several seconds).
-> mplayer seems to crash after a while when a large file is played. If you have a solution, please send us a pull request.

== Video Application Appendix A: ~/.omxplayer ==
In order to get this running with omxplayer, you MUST create a file ~/.omxplayer with the following content (note that PAUSE: has a space behind it):
     DECREASE_SPEED:1
     INCREASE_SPEED:2
     REWIND:<
     FAST_FORWARD:>
     SHOW_INFO:z
     PREVIOUS_AUDIO:j
     NEXT_AUDIO:k
     PREVIOUS_CHAPTER:i
     NEXT_CHAPTER:o
     PREVIOUS_SUBTITLE:n
     NEXT_SUBTITLE:m
     TOGGLE_SUBTITLE:s
     DECREASE_SUBTITLE_DELAY:d
     INCREASE_SUBTITLE_DELAY:f
     EXIT:q
     PAUSE:
     DECREASE_VOLUME:-
     INCREASE_VOLUME:+
     SEEK_BACK_SMALL:x
     SEEK_FORWARD_SMALL:c
     SEEK_BACK_LARGE:y
     SEEK_FORWARD_LARGE:v
     STEP:p
     TOGGLE_SUBTITLE:s

== Video Application Appendix B: ~/.mplayer/input.conf ==
     ' seek +30
     " seek -30
     & seek +600
     % seek -600
