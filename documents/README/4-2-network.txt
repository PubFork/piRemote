NETWORK:

The communication between the server (i.e. the Raspberry Pi) and the client (i.e. Android application) is stateless and happens with UDP-packets.
The network works in a simple way:

	1. The Dispatcher-Thread receives the messages over a socket. It manages the messages and either directly sends some messages back to the client/server or forwards the message to the client.
	2. The KeepAlive-Thread continuously sends messages to the client/server and recognizes when a client/server does not respond within a certain time.
	3. The Sender-Thread is in charge of picking messages from a queue and sending them to the determined recipient.

In fact, the network is actually hidden from the user. To send a message to the server, the application goes over the core by calling a function sendMessage().
