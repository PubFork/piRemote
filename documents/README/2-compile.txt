COMPILING PIREMOTE:

PiRemote consists of 3 parts: shared, server and client. We use IntelliJ Idea for shared and server and Android Studio for client.
- Setting up the IntelliJ Idea projects: After import, go to File -> Project Structure. We use Project SDK 1.8 and language level 7.
- Setting up the Android Studio project: After import, go to File -> Project Structure and verify that Sdk Version is API 18 or higher. Source and Target Compatibility should be at least 1.7.

Once you have all three projects set up, your are ready to compile:
1. First, compile piRemoteShared. Build the piRemoteShared.jar artifact. In IntelliJ:
	- Setup your IntelliJ project (do this once): File -> Project Structure -> Artifacts -> '+' -> JAR -> From modules with dependencies... -> OK -> Apply -> OK
	- Every time an update is required: Build -> Build Artifacts... -> Build
	- The .jar can be found in "./out/artifacts/piRemoteShared_jar/piRemoteShared.jar"
2. Then, this file needs to be included in the two projects:
	- IntelliJ (server): File -> Project Structure -> Libraries -> '+' -> Java -> Select JAR -> OK -> Apply -> OK
	- Android Studio (client): Create directory "libs" in "app" (./app/libs/), copy JAR there (it should be autodetected).
3. You may now run the server on your PC or build the piRemoteServer.jar artifact as in the first step. On the Raspberry Pi you may run the jar file using: java -jar piRemoteServer.jar
