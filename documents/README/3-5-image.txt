IMAGE APPLICATION:

With the ImageApplication a client is able to show images on the Raspberry Pi. Please note, that the Raspberry Pi has to be connected to a external screen. The PiRemote Server must be started from the graphical environment (not ssh).
The Raspberry Pi itself uses the ‘geeqie image viewer’ to display the images. For more information about ‘geeqie’ see http://geeqie.sourceforge.net

For the best experience, users should pick the first image in a folder. Then they can navigate through the images with the arrows on the app.

On slow devices such as the Raspberry Pi 1, requests can queue up if buttons are pressed to fast. PiRemote will not be responsive until the queue is processed completely.
