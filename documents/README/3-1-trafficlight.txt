TRAFFIC LIGHT APPLICATION

TrafficLightApplication doesn't do anything useful, it was just built for testing the protocol. You might find it useful for verifying connectivity and consistency across all devices.

-> Colors (red / orange / green) shoud be consistent within seconds across all connected devices.
-> The file name indicated to the right of the file picker is broadcasted once at every pick action. Devices connecting at a later point will not receive the broadcast.
