TRAFFIC LIGHT APPLICATION:

TrafficLightApplication does not do anything useful. It was built to test the protocol in the first place. You might find it useful for verifying connectivity and consistency across all devices.

- Colors (red / orange / green) should be consistent within seconds across all connected devices.
- The file name indicated to the right of the file picker is broadcasted once at every pick action. Devices connecting at a later point will not receive the broadcast.
