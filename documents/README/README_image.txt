IMAGE_APPLICATION:

With the ImageApplication a client is able to show some images on the RaspberryPi. Please note, that the RaspberryPi has to be connected to a external screen via HDMI.
The RaspberryPi itself uses the ‘geeqie image viewer’ to display the images. For more information about ‘geeqie’ see http://geeqie.sourceforge.net

For the best experience, the user should pick the first image in a folder. Then he can navigate through the images with the arrows on the app.
