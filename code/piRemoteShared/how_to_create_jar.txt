How to create the .jar file:

Do this once:
File -> Project Structure -> Artifacts -> '+' -> JAR -> From modules with dependencies... -> OK -> Apply -> OK

Everytime an update is required
Build -> Build Artifacts... -> Build

The .jar can be found in "./out/artifacts/piRemoteShared_jar/piRemoteShared.jar"
This file needs to be included then in the two projects.
The file will not be synced, please create it locally when an update has been done.
